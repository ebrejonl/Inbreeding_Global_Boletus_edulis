## On the vcf with all lineage genotyped on the common best reference (but filtered seperated into different vcf), we compute the pairwise relatedness
# This measure of the relatedness is based on the KING algorythm
# We then use this measure to identify the clones, or the pairs with relatedness equals or greater than 0.354
# this threshold value is defined and explained in the method's paper (Manichaikul et al, 2010)
# This analysis was useful to identify the lists of genetically different individuals (genets) per lineage
# We used these lists for the genotyping on their specific references and the ROH calling.
