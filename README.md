# ROH_CALLING_edulis
Repository for Brejon Lamartinière et al, (2023) Runs of Homozygosity reveal contrasting histories of inbreeding across global lineages of the edible mushroom, Boletus edulis.

It contains the script to go from raw fastq reads to standardized inbreeding estimates using FROH.
It probably needs a computing cluster to be run, since most jobs require lots of ressources and output huge files.

All raw data are available:
1) The genomic data at the BioProject accession #PRJNA1010140
2) The elevation data at the GLOBE, Hasting et al, 1999 at https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/topo/
3) The niche modelling was made as in Tremble et al, 2023 with the open-source software MAXENT


This repository along with the methods section of Brejon Lamartinière et al. 2023 should allow full reproducibility.
